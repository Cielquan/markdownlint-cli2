## Install

```shell
npm install markdownlint-cli2 --save-dev
```

## Overview

- [`markdownlint`][markdownlint] is a library for linting [Markdown][markdown]/
  [CommonMark][commonmark] files on [Node.js][nodejs] using the
  [markdown-it][markdown-it] parser.
- [`markdownlint-cli`][markdownlint-cli] is a traditional command-line interface
  for `markdownlint`.
- [`markdownlint-cli2`][markdownlint-cli2] is a slightly unconventional
  command-line interface for `markdownlint`.
- `markdownlint-cli2` is configuration-based and prioritizes both speed and
  simplicity.
- `markdownlint-cli2` is mostly compatible with the features of
  `markdownlint-cli`.
- [`vscode-markdownlint`][vscode-markdownlint] is a `markdownlint` extension for
  the [Visual Studio Code editor][vscode].
- `markdownlint-cli2` is meant to work well in conjunction with
  `vscode-markdownlint`.

## Use

```text
markdownlint-cli2 version X.Y.Z by David Anson (https://dlaa.me/)
https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2

Syntax: markdownlint-cli2 glob0 [glob1] [...] [globN]

Glob expressions (from the globby library):
- * matches any number of characters, but not /
- ? matches a single character, but not /
- ** matches any number of characters, including / (when it's the only thing in a path part)
- {} allows for a comma-separated list of "or" expressions
- ! or # at the beginning of a pattern negate the match

Configuration:
- Via .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc, .markdownlint.jsonc, .markdownlint.json, .markdownlint.yaml, or .markdownlint.yml

Cross-platform compatibility:
- UNIX and Windows shells expand globs according to different rules, so quoting glob arguments is recommended
- Shells that expand globs do not support negated patterns (!node_modules), so quoting negated globs is required
- Some Windows shells do not handle single-quoted (') arguments correctly, so double-quotes (") are recommended
- Some UNIX shells handle exclamation (!) in double-quotes specially, so hashtag (#) is recommended for negated globs
- Some shells use backslash (\) to escape special characters, so forward slash (/) is the recommended path separator

Therefore, the most compatible syntax for cross-platform support:
markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "#node_modules"
```

### Exit Codes

- `0`: Linting was successful and there were no errors
- `1`: Linting was successful and there were errors
- `2`: Linting was not completed due to a runtime issue

## Rule List

- See the [Rules / Aliases][markdownlint-rules-aliases] and
  [Tags][markdownlint-tags] sections of the `markdownlint` documentation.

## Glob expressions

- Globbing is performed by the [globby][globby] library; refer to that
  documentation for more information and examples.

## Configuration

- See the [Configuration][markdownlint-configuration] section of the
  `markdownlint` documentation for information about the inline comment syntax.

### `.markdownlintignore`

- The format of this file is similar to [`.npmignore`][npmignore] and consists
  of one glob pattern per line.
- These glob patterns are negated (by adding a leading `!`) and appended to the
  end of the command-line arguments.
- Blank lines and lines that begin with the `#` character are ignored.

### `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`

- The format of this file is a [JSONC][jsonc] object similar to the
  [`markdownlint` `options` object][markdownlint-options].
- Valid properties are:
  - `config`: [`markdownlint` `config` object][markdownlint-config] to configure
    rules for this part of the directory tree
    - If a `jsonc`/`json`/`yaml`/`yml` file (see below) is present in the same
      directory, it overrides the value of this property
  - `customRules`: `Array` of `Strings` of module names/paths of
    [custom rules][markdownlint-custom-rules] to load and use when linting
    - Each `String` is passed as the `id` parameter to Node's
      [require function][nodejs-require]
    - Relative paths are resolved based on the location of the `JSONC` file
  - `fix`: `Boolean` value to enable fixing of linting errors reported by rules
    that emit fix information
    - Fixes are made directly to the relevant file(s); no backup is created
  - `frontMatter`: `String` defining the [`RegExp`][regexp] used to match and
    ignore any [front matter][front-matter] at the beginning of Markdown content
    - The `String` is passed as the `pattern` parameter to the
      [`RegExp` constructor][regexp-constructor]
    - For example: `(^---\s*$[^]*?^---\s*$)(\r\n|\r|\n|$)`
  - `markdownItPlugins`: `Array` of `Array`s, each of which has a `String`
    naming a [markdown-it plugin][markdown-it-plugins] followed by parameters
    - Plugins can be used to add support for additional Markdown syntax
    - For example: `[ [ "plugin-name", param_0, param_1, ... ], ... ]`
  - `noInlineConfig`: `Boolean` value to disable the support of
    [HTML comments][html-comment] within Markdown content
    - For example: `<!-- markdownlint-disable some-rule -->`
- Settings in this file apply to the directory it is in and all subdirectories.
- Settings **merge with** those applied by any versions of this file in a parent
  directory.
- For example: A [`.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`][markdownlint-cli2-jsonc] with all
  properties set

### `.markdownlint.jsonc` / `.markdownlint.json`

- The format of this file is a [JSON][json] or [JSONC][jsonc] object matching
  the [`markdownlint` `config` object][markdownlint-config].
- Settings in this file apply to the directory it is in and all subdirectories
- Settings **override** those applied by any versions of this file in a parent
  directory.
- If both files are present in the same directory, the `jsonc` version takes
  precedence.
- To merge the settings of these files or share configuration, use the `extends`
  property (documented above).
- Both extensions support comments in JSON.

### `.markdownlint.yaml` / `.markdownlint.yml`

- The format of this file is a [YAML][yaml] object representing
  [`markdownlint`'s `config` object][markdownlint-config].
- Other details are the same as for `jsonc`/`json` files described above.
- If both files are present in the same directory, the `yaml` version takes
  precedence.
- If a `jsonc` or `json` file is present, it takes precedence according the
  rules above.

## Compatibility

### `markdownlint-cli`

- The glob implementation and handling of patterns is different.
- The treatment of `.markdownlintignore` patterns is different.
- Configuration files are supported in each directory (vs. one globally).
- The `INI` config format and `.markdownlintrc` are not supported.

### `vscode-markdownlint`

- The treatment of `.markdownlintignore` patterns is different.
- `.markdownlintrc` is not supported as a configuration file.
