markdownlint-cli2 version X.Y.Z by David Anson (https://dlaa.me/)
https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2

Syntax: markdownlint-cli2 glob0 [glob1] [...] [globN]

Glob expressions (from the globby library):
- * matches any number of characters, but not /
- ? matches a single character, but not /
- ** matches any number of characters, including / (when it's the only thing in a path part)
- {} allows for a comma-separated list of "or" expressions
- ! or # at the beginning of a pattern negate the match

Configuration:
- Via .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc, .markdownlint.jsonc, .markdownlint.json, .markdownlint.yaml, or .markdownlint.yml

Cross-platform compatibility:
- UNIX and Windows shells expand globs according to different rules, so quoting glob arguments is recommended
- Shells that expand globs do not support negated patterns (!node_modules), so quoting negated globs is required
- Some Windows shells do not handle single-quoted (') arguments correctly, so double-quotes (") are recommended
- Some UNIX shells handle exclamation (!) in double-quotes specially, so hashtag (#) is recommended for negated globs
- Some shells use backslash (\) to escape special characters, so forward slash (/) is the recommended path separator

Therefore, the most compatible syntax for cross-platform support:
markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "#node_modules"
