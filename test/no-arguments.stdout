Syntax: markdownlint-cli2 glob0 [glob1] [...] [globN]

Glob expressions (from the globby library):
- * matches any number of characters, but not /
- ? matches a single character, but not /
- ** matches any number of characters, including / (when it's the only thing in a path part)
- {} allows for a comma-separated list of "or" expressions
- ! or # at the beginning of a pattern negate the match

Dot-only glob:
- The command "markdownlint-cli2 ." would lint every file in the current directory tree which is probably not intended
- Instead, it is mapped to "markdownlint-cli2 *.{md,markdown}" which lints all Markdown files in the current directory
- To lint every file in the current directory tree, the command "markdownlint-cli2 **" can be used instead

Configuration via:
- .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc
- .markdownlint-cli2.yaml
- .markdownlint-cli2.js
- .markdownlint.jsonc or .markdownlint.json
- .markdownlint.yaml or .markdownlint.yml
- .markdownlint.js

Cross-platform compatibility:
- UNIX and Windows shells expand globs according to different rules, so quoting glob arguments is recommended
- Shells that expand globs do not support negated patterns (!node_modules), so quoting negated globs is required
- Some Windows shells do not handle single-quoted (') arguments correctly, so double-quote (") is recommended
- Some UNIX shells handle exclamation (!) in double-quotes, so hashtag (#) is recommended for negated globs
- The path separator is forward slash (/) on all platforms; backslash (\) is automatically converted on Windows

Therefore, the most compatible glob syntax for cross-platform support:
$ markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "#node_modules"
